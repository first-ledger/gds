# Graphical Design System

## Introduction

This is a shared system for the graphical design of the First Ledger and First Ledger Mobile applications.
It uses the style dictionary to generate the tokens and typography from export from Figma.

## Development

> **Note:** Please do not modify the `static` directory and the `tokens.json` file within the directory. This file is generated by a figma plugin called TokenBruker and is essential for the integrity of the design system.

- pnpm (v9.15.4)

### Installation

```bash
pnpm i
```

### Development

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Design Token Convention

The design token convention is a systematic approach to managing design decisions in a consistent and scalable manner. Design tokens are named entities that store visual design attributes, such as colors, typography, spacing, and more. They serve as the foundation for a design system, allowing for easy updates and maintenance across various platforms and applications.

### Token Prefix Convention

In our design token system, all tokens are prefixed with `flds`, which stands for **First Ledger Design System**. This prefix helps to clearly identify and categorize the tokens associated with our design system, ensuring that they are easily distinguishable from other tokens that may be used in different contexts or projects.

For example:

- **Color Tokens**: `flds-color-primary`, `flds-color-secondary`
- **Typography Tokens**: `flds-font-size-base`, `flds-font-weight-bold`
- **Spacing Tokens**: `flds-spacing-small`, `flds-spacing-large`
- **Shadow Tokens**: `flds-shadow-elevation-1`, `flds-shadow-elevation-2`

By adopting this prefix convention, we enhance the clarity and maintainability of our design tokens, making it easier for developers and designers to work collaboratively within the First Ledger ecosystem.

### Primitive Tokens

Primitive tokens are fundamental design elements that serve as the building blocks of our design system. Unlike other tokens that are assigned to specific modes (such as Dark or Light themes), primitive tokens are not tied to any particular visual style or context. Instead, they are intended to remain in a constant state for reference across the entire application.

These tokens typically include basic attributes such as colors, typography, spacing, and shadows that are universally applicable. By keeping primitive tokens separate from mode-specific tokens, we ensure that they can be easily accessed and utilized in various design scenarios without being influenced by the current theme or mode.

For example, a primitive color token might define a base color that can be used in both light and dark themes, while a primitive spacing token could establish a standard margin or padding value that is consistent across all components. This approach promotes consistency and scalability within the design system, allowing for easier updates and maintenance.

In summary, primitive tokens provide a stable reference point for design decisions, ensuring that core design principles are upheld regardless of the visual context in which they are applied.

### Mode-Specific Tokens

Mode specific tokens are design tokens that are tailored to specific themes or contexts within the application. These tokens allow for a more nuanced approach to styling, ensuring that the visual representation aligns with the intended user experience for each mode.

#### Dark Mode Tokens

Dark mode tokens are specifically designed to enhance readability and accessibility in low-light environments. They typically include:

- **Background Colors**: Darker shades that reduce glare and eye strain.
- **Text Colors**: Lighter shades that provide sufficient contrast against dark backgrounds.
- **Accent Colors**: Vibrant colors that stand out against dark themes, ensuring important elements are easily noticeable.

#### Light Mode Tokens

Light mode tokens cater to bright environments, providing a fresh and clean aesthetic. Key components include:

- **Background Colors**: Lighter shades that create an open and airy feel.
- **Text Colors**: Darker shades that ensure readability against light backgrounds.
- **Accent Colors**: Softer tones that complement the overall light theme while maintaining visibility.

#### Accessibility Considerations

When defining mode specific tokens, it is crucial to consider accessibility standards. This includes ensuring sufficient color contrast ratios for text and interactive elements, as well as providing alternative styles for users with visual impairments. By adhering to these principles, we can create a more inclusive design system that caters to a diverse audience.

In summary, mode specific tokens play a vital role in delivering a tailored user experience, enhancing both aesthetics and functionality across different themes.
